Full Summary of the Solution
This Python script is designed to manage Akamai Identity Cloud user access groups by checking if a group already exists and creating it if it does not. The script authenticates API requests using credentials stored in a .edgerc file, which is common practice for securely handling API authentication with Akamai's EdgeGrid.

Key Components:
Authentication Using .edgerc:

The script uses the EdgeRc class to read the .edgerc file, which contains the client_token, client_secret, access_token, and host required for authenticating API requests.
The EdgeGridAuth class is then used to authenticate the requests. This setup ensures that all API calls are securely signed and authenticated using the credentials stored in the .edgerc file.
Session Setup:

The setup_session function initializes a requests.Session object and configures it with the EdgeGridAuth using the credentials extracted from the .edgerc file. This session is used for all subsequent API calls to ensure they are authenticated.
Checking Group Existence:

The check_group_exists function sends a GET request to the Akamai API to retrieve a list of existing groups. It checks if the specified group already exists in this list. If it does, the script will not attempt to create it again.
Creating a Group:

If the group does not exist, the create_group function sends a POST request to the Akamai API to create a new group under a specified parent group ID. This function uses the group name provided as an argument and submits it as part of the API request payload.
Command-Line Interface:

The script uses the argparse library to handle command-line arguments, making it flexible and easy to use. The required arguments are:
group_name: The name of the group to be created.
parent_group_id: The ID of the parent group under which the new group will be created.
--edgerc_file: (Optional) The path to the .edgerc file. Defaults to ~/.edgerc.
--section_name: (Optional) The section in the .edgerc file to use for authentication. Defaults to default.
Running the Script:
To execute the script, you would use a command like:

bash
Copy code
python script.py "NewGroupName" "ParentGroupID" --edgerc_file="~/.edgerc" --section_name="default"

This command will:
Check if a group named "NewGroupName" exists under the specified ParentGroupID.
If the group does not exist, it will create the group using the provided credentials in the .edgerc file under the specified section.

Summary of Workflow:
Authentication: The script securely authenticates API requests using Akamai’s EdgeGridAuth with credentials from the .edgerc file.
Group Management: It checks if the specified group already exists in Akamai Identity Cloud.
Conditional Creation: If the group doesn't exist, it creates a new group under the specified parent group.
CLI Flexibility: The script is flexible, accepting various command-line arguments to customize its behavior.
This solution is robust for environments that require secure API interactions with Akamai’s services, ensuring that access groups are managed efficiently and securely.
