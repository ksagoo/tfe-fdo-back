Hi Helen,

I hope you are doing well.

I was advised by Tom Gulliver to reach out to you regarding a requirement we are exploring within the CyberWasp DevOps Automation team.

We are currently working on Akamai shift-left automation, and as part of this, we were looking at whether it might be possible to update the SNOW Standard Change Template to include a custom field. The idea is to capture the ADLDS group that the change raiser is a member of, which would then be mapped to the corresponding Akamai Access Group for which the change is being requested.

The purpose of this is to ensure that only users with the correct entitlement can raise changes related to specific Akamai resources (e.g., certificate renewals, property creation, security activation, etc.), and to help us cross-reference entitlements more efficiently.

Would you be open to scheduling a short meeting to walk through the requirement and discuss whether this could fit within the current change management process, or if there are alternative approaches we should consider?

Thanks in advance for your guidance.

Best regards,
Kuldeep
