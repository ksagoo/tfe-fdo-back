Storing Terraform state in GitHub (or any Git-based version control system) is not recommended for several important reasons:

1. Sensitive Data Exposure
Terraform state files (terraform.tfstate) often contain sensitive data:

Cloud credentials
Passwords
Secrets
Resource metadata (e.g., IPs, tokens)

GitHub  can expose these values, violating security best practices and possibly compliance regulations (like GDPR or PCI-DSS).

2. No Concurrency Control
Git doesn’t handle simultaneous updates to state files well:

If multiple users or CI pipelines apply changes at the same time, it can corrupt the state file.

There’s no locking mechanism in Git to prevent race conditions.

3. Inefficient State Management
State files are frequently updated:

Every Terraform plan/apply modifies the file.

This leads to constant Git commits, bloating the history and making Git logs noisy.

Merging state file changes is error-prone and typically not possible.
