Step 2: Attach Change Tickets

You must include two separate change tickets with your request:

    Onboarding Change Ticket

        Must be fully approved

        Must fall within the scheduled change window

    Property Activation & Security Configuration Ticket

        Can be in Draft initially

        Must be fully approved prior to production activation

System validations ensure:

    Change ticket status is approved

    Assignment group is correct

    Approver belongs to the assignment group

Step 3: Submit Form and Trigger Automation

Once submitted, the request transitions to the Submitted state. This action triggers a webhook to Jenkins, which begins processing.
Step 4: Confirmation Email

!06.jpeg|width=700!

You will receive a confirmation email indicating that your onboarding request has been received and automation has been triggered.
Step 5: Jenkins – Access Group and Change Ticket Validation

!07.jpeg|width=700!

The pipeline performs the following checks:

    Validates the access group exists

    Confirms both change tickets meet approval and timing requirements

If any validation fails, the ticket is returned to the requestor.
Step 6: CPS and Site Delivery Creation

A new Site Delivery is created. Certificate Provisioning System (CPS) requests are initiated based on the property and domain.
Step 7: Activate Site Delivery in Staging

!09.jpeg|width=700!

The pipeline activates the property in the Staging Akamai network. This ensures the configuration is fully tested before going to production.
Step 8: Clone Security Configuration from Template

!10.jpeg|width=700!

A security configuration is cloned from the pre-approved Security Policy Template, including:

    Client Lists

    Custom Rules

    Rate Limits

    Reputation Profiles

All cloned items are renamed using the format:
SC-<AccessGroup>-<OriginalNameSuffix>
Step 9: Jenkins Pipeline Output

!11.jpeg|width=700!

Pipeline logs and outputs are updated in real-time. Any failures are automatically flagged and pushed to Jira with detailed trace logs.
Step 10: Email Notification for Production Approval

!15.jpeg|width=700!

Once staging is successful, an approval email is sent to designated approvers for production deployment authorization.
Step 11: Manual Approval via Jira or ServiceNow

!16.jpeg|width=700!

The assigned approver reviews and approves via the linked ticketing system. Once approved, production deployment proceeds.
Step 12: Activate in Production

!17.jpeg|width=700!

The final production activation is performed. This includes Akamai configuration updates for property and security policies.
Step 13: Final Notification

!18.jpeg|width=700!

A final confirmation email is sent to the requester confirming successful onboarding and production deployment.
Step 14: Jira Ticket Closure

!19.jpeg|width=700!

The Jira ticket transitions to Completed. A complete audit trail is attached to the issue, including logs, screenshots, and timestamps.
Step 15: Summary of Cloned Entities

!20.jpeg|width=700!

The following elements are logged:

    Client lists cloned

    Rate policies applied

    Custom rules reassigned

    Match targets reassigned

Step 16: Handling Failures and Retries

!21.jpeg|width=700!

If any part of the onboarding fails:

    You will receive an email notification

    The Jira ticket will indicate the failure reason

    You can re-trigger the onboarding by correcting the issue and transitioning the ticket again
